    <h1>Opportunity is not for the prepared</h1>

    <p><strong>Opportunity is not for the prepared.<br>
    It is for the bold.</strong></p>

    <p>We were taught to wait until we are ready.<br>
    To understand first, then act.</p>

    <p>Reality works differently.</p>

    <p>Many people who get opportunities don’t know more —<br>
    they just step in earlier.</p>

    <p>Ignorance doesn’t stop action.<br>
    Hesitation does.</p>

    <p>Most opportunities are not given.<br>
    They are taken.</p>
