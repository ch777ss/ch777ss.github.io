<p>
  I used to think that public behavior
  was mostly shaped by education or punishment.
</p>

<p>
  But watching how people behave in elevators,
  on public transport, or in shared spaces,
  I started to suspect something else.
</p>

<p>
  In many places, certain behaviors don’t disappear
  because they are punished,
  but because they are embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
  Once a behavior is widely considered shameful,
  it no longer needs enforcement.
  People begin to self-regulate.
</p>

<p>
  This seems especially visible
  when comparing developed and developing societies.
</p>

<p>
  I’m not sure shame is a good mechanism.
  But it appears to be a powerful one.
