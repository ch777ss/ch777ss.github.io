<p>
Recently I listened to a Google Podcast episode where Demis Hassabis talked
about artificial intelligence and the nature of computation.
</p>

<p>
He described a worldview in which the universe is, in principle, computable.
He remains deeply fascinated by the Turing Test, and sees his life’s work as
an ongoing exploration of the boundary between human intelligence and
computation.
</p>

<p>
My own observation is much more modest.
</p>

<p>
What feels increasingly valuable are the things that resist computation —
not because they are mystical, but because they are deeply human.
</p>

<p>
Real skin-to-skin touch.
The pheromonal signals of animals.
Live performances that are never exactly the same twice.
Small, unplanned mistakes that emerge in the moment.
</p>

<p>
As Rick Rubin wrote in <em>The Creative Act</em>,
“Errors are how humanity breathes.”
</p>

<p>
These imperfections are not bugs in the system.
They are evidence of presence.
</p>

<p>
In a future where technology becomes extraordinarily advanced,
machines may indeed make us smarter.
They may help us reason better, calculate faster, and see further.
</p>

<p>
But at the same time, the qualities that only humans possess
may become increasingly rare.
</p>

<p>
Not because they disappear —
but because everything else becomes so efficiently computed.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the role of technology is not to replace these qualities,
but to make us notice them again.
