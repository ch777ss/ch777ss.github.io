    <h1>Emotion as Information</h1>
    <div class="date">2026-02-07</div>

    <p>
      I used to believe that emotional stability was a virtue.<br>
      That clarity meant calmness.<br>
      That being “positive” was a form of strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, under sustained fatigue, lack of exercise, and a chaotic environment,<br>
      I noticed something different.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emotions did not weaken my thinking.<br>
      They sharpened my perception.
    </p>

    <p>
      From an evolutionary perspective, emotion is tightly coupled with safety.<br>
      Tension, anger, anxiety are not moral failures —<br>
      they are signals that prediction has broken down.
    </p>

    <p>
      To feel uneasy is to detect danger.<br>
      To feel irritated is to sense misalignment.<br>
      To feel overwhelmed is to realize that an explanation no longer holds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem begins when emotions are treated as noise.<br>
      When “optimism” is used to suppress signals rather than interpret them.<br>
      When calmness is mistaken for understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Deutsch’s sense, progress does not come from emotional regulation,<br>
      but from better explanations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emotion is often the first indicator that our current model of reality is insufficient.<br>
      Not something to be erased,<br>
      but something to be examined.
    </p>

    <p>
      The task is not to escape chaos,<br>
      but to observe within it.
    </p>

    <p>
      To separate signal from distortion.<br>
      To extract facts from feeling.<br>
      To gain a more precise understanding of oneself and the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Errors are not endpoints.<br>
      They are invitations to improve explanations.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in that sense, having emotions — and noticing them — is not a regression.<br>
      It is the beginning of understanding.
