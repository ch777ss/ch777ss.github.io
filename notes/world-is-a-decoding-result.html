    <h1>The World Is Not the World.</h1>
    <h1>It Is a Decoding Result.</h1>

    <div class="subtitle">February 2026 · Chess’ Notebook</div>

    <p>
      We often assume we are observing the world.
      A sentence is said.
      An event happens.
      Someone remains silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      And we believe we are responding to facts.
    </p>

    <p>
      But over time, I’ve begun to suspect something else:
      we are not reading the world itself —
      we are decoding it through who we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same words can sound like care to one person and offense to another.
      The same silence can feel respectful, or dismissive.
      The same situation can appear as opportunity, or as threat.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is tempting to think the world is inconsistent.
      But perhaps the inconsistency lies elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps what differs is the decoder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone carries a default setting —
      an implicit assumption about what the world is like.
    </p>

    <p>
      If one assumes scarcity, competition, and defense,
      the world will appear narrow, tense, and hostile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not because it is objectively so,
      but because this interpretation maintains internal coherence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that sense,
      we rarely judge the world —
      we continuously confirm ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Narrow interpretations are not always rooted in malice.
      More often, they are rooted in fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fear of ambiguity.
      Fear of uncertainty.
      Fear that things may not mean what we assumed they meant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conclusions, then, become useful.
      They fence reality into something manageable.
    </p>

    <p>
      A conclusion does not have to be accurate —
      it only needs to feel stabilizing.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this way,
      simplistic explanations offer a form of psychological safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real difference between people, I’ve found,
      is not intelligence or morality,
      but tolerance for uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open individuals are not necessarily optimistic.
      They simply endure complexity better.
    </p>

    <p>
      They hesitate before assigning intent.
      They resist collapsing ambiguity into accusation.
      They leave room for alternatives.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Maybe this is not the only explanation.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This has changed how I think about freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Freedom may not mean possessing better answers.
      It may mean not being captured by the first interpretation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not forcing positivity.
      Not suspending judgment indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just allowing the world a moment
      before defining it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t claim mastery over this process.
      Old decoding patterns still activate automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      But awareness matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      I now recognize the mirror.
      I know that what I see may not be the world itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps growth is not about correcting reality,
      but about refining the instrument through which we read it.
    </p>

    <p>
      And perhaps that, in itself,
      is already a form of freedom.
